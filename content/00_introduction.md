# Introduction

## What is Iron?

**Iron is a modern compiled language.** Similar to (and inspired by) other modern languages like Rust, Go, and Swift, Iron aims to make it easy to build complex applications that are performant and free from many common classes of bugs.

**Iron is new and not yet production-ready.** This website and our repositories are available because we strongly believe in building in the open. We intend to write at length about the language design and development process on our journey to `v1.0`.

## What is this website?

The page that you are on now hosts the Iron language guide in its entirety. This includes our design decisions, steps for installation, an overview of Iron's concepts and syntax, and even recipes for common projects (e.g. web services). The guide will evolve as the language evolves and, as mentioned above, will eventually host a blog.
