# Introduction

### Welcome to the official homepage for the Iron language project. This page serves as a guide for the language and Forge, its associated toolchain.

## What is Iron?

**Iron is a modern compiled programming language.** Inspired by other modern languages (e.g. Rust, Go, Swift), Iron aims to make it easy to build complex applications that are performant and free from many common classes of bugs. Iron also aims to distinguish itself from those languages in many ways, but primarily through (1) a minimal feature surface area and (2) an opinionated developer experience.

**Iron is new and not yet production-ready.** This website and our repositories are available because we strongly believe in building in the open. We intend to write at length about the language design and development process on our journey to `v1.0`.

## What is Forge?

**Forge is a comprehensive toolchain for managing Iron projects.** You will learn more about it later, but for now, think of it as a tool similar to `npm` or `cargo`. Specifically, it will allow you to:

- Scaffold new projects, optionally based on existing templates
- Lint and format your source code
- Execute your project as a script
- Design, debug, and execute unit and integration tests
- Build your project into a binary for a supported platform
- Generate and deploy Iron module documentation

## What is this website?

The page that you are on now hosts the Iron language guide in its entirety. This includes our design decisions, steps for installation, an overview of Iron's concepts and syntax, and even recipes for common projects (e.g. web services). The guide will evolve as the language evolves and, as mentioned above, will eventually host a blog.
